# Iris Dataset Classification with K-Fold Cross-Validation

This project uses the Iris dataset from Kaggle to classify iris species using machine learning. The model is evaluated using K-Fold cross-validation to obtain an average accuracy score, providing a more reliable metric for model performance.

## Overview

This project aims to classify iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. A machine learning model is trained on the Iris dataset and evaluated using K-Fold cross-validation. The cross-validation approach provides a robust measure of model accuracy by splitting the data into multiple subsets, training, and testing on each subset, and calculating an average accuracy score.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset, obtained from Kaggle, includes 150 samples of iris flowers with the following attributes:

- **Sepal Length**: Length of the sepal in cm.
- **Sepal Width**: Width of the sepal in cm.
- **Petal Length**: Length of the petal in cm.
- **Petal Width**: Width of the petal in cm.
- **Species**: The type of iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

## Features

- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Utilizes K-Fold cross-validation for model evaluation, improving accuracy estimates.
- **Accuracy Score**: Calculates and displays the average accuracy score across K-Fold splits.
- **Versatile Classification**: Can be adapted to test different classifiers for improved performance.

## Installation
